My person website and the Guessing Game project:

This is a simple project geared toward developing my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. It contains my personal webite and some basic JavaScript interactivity, where users respond to questions and the answers will appear on the page.

No citations to report, other than Mark's Code 201 Github demonstrations as a reference.
